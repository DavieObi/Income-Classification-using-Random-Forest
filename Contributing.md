# Contributing to Developer Salary Prediction Model

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Developer Salary Prediction Model** project!  
This project is designed to estimate software developer salaries based on factors such as experience, location, education and role. Every contribution — whether small or large — helps improve its accuracy, usability and impact.



## 🏆 How You Can Contribute

- **Data Enhancement**: Extend or improve the dataset. e.g., include additional countries, more experience levels, more features like job title, company size or bonus.  
- **Model Improvement**: Try alternative regression algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, feature engineering, or advanced techniques like SHAP for interpretability.  
- **Visualization & Analysis**: Add insightful charts, correlation heatmaps, interactive dashboards or notebooks that help users understand model behaviour.  
- **Documentation**: Improve README, write beginner-friendly walkthroughs, code comments, usage examples, or deployment instructions.  
- **Testing & Reproducibility**: Add unit tests, ensure notebooks run end-to-end, improve model deployment pipeline, or simplify the user interface.
